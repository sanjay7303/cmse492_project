# Stroke Prediction Project for CMSE 492
### Sanjay Subramanian

## Description

The following project is to use machine learning to see which of the many features are heavily dependent on whether a particular patient will get a stroke or not. As stroke is one of the leading causes of deaths it would be imperative to identity the root cause of this using machine learning. The dataset was found through kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset by fedesoriano. 

## Project Objectives 

The main core of this project is to use a variety of machine learning algorithms to come about the highly accurate one amongst its features, this will be the main bulk of the project. It would also be useful to initially prepare the data to make sure it is ready to be fed into the algorithm. Performing a one hot encoding of the categorical variables as well as imputing the missing values would be the ideal first step. Furthermore, understanding the data by performing an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) would be important in knowing on what sort of data we are working with. Lastly, then it would be creating the machine learning models for our prediction. 

## Running and Setting up the code

For running the code I will be using python and jupyter notebook for setting up my code. I will also be using any neccessary markdown cells to explain my code. 

## Dependancies and Requirements

One of the main dependancies is imputing the missing values, which have to be done correctly. Also the main requirements would be importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation and machine learning, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn. 

## Folder Structure

For the following repository, I have created a datasets folder for all of the data that I will using in this project. This will include the raw data that I will initially be using and also the clean data as well. I have also created a notebooks folder which will include the visualizations and charts used for my EDA as well as the final notebook with all the steps in sequential order from start to finish for my whole project. I also have a reports folder which include my drafts for the project report as well as the final folder for my final project report. Lastly, I have added a results folder which will include the EDA visualizations only as well as some calculated statistics.
